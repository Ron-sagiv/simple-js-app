# A JavaScript App - Pokedex

## A Objective
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## A Key features
* Load data from an external source (API)
* View a list of items
* On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item

## A Technical Requirements

### A Required:
* The app must load data from an external API; for instance, ([the Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/)).
* The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
* The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
* The app must have CSS styling.
* The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
 -  The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
 -  The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
* The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.
 -  The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
* The app must not throw any errors when being used.
* The app <ins>should</ins> be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages. You can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's [Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting](https://careerfoundry.com/en/steps/code-quality-testing-web-hosting-se).
* The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11

### A Nice to Have
* The app should show loading indicators while loading data.
* The app should handle errors (such as trying to load data while offline) and show user-friendly
error messages.
